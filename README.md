## About The Project
![example_screenshot](src/assets/readme/example_screen.png)

This is a basic replica of whatsapp in layout and functions, built with ![vue.js](src/assets/readme/vue.svg) and ![bootstrap](src/assets/readme/bootstrap.svg)

This replica currently allows you to:

* send messages while receiving a standard automatic response
* view the contact's last login, which updates dynamically
* delete messages from the chat
* search for contacts by name
